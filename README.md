#### 🏊 What is the PoolParty token?

These are two smart contracts, attached to your ERC20, that allow you to Follow and Reward your token holders.
As everything in life, things are more clear with a diagram:

As seen, we can code that every time a certain event occurs, or every time you pull the smart contract’s trigger, the funds collected by token contributions will be shared between all the token holders equally. Meaning, the longer you keep your tokens, the higher number of times you get paid (rewarded) by the PoolParty token.

This approach encourages holders to maintain ownership of these tokens, as they expect future returns from them.
